# htaccess-for-codeigniter

use the content file as .htaccess on your root directory, This will 
1.  remove index.php from your url and redirect to seo friendly url.
2.  Allow permission on selective folders only to be interpreted.
3.  redirect index.php url to corresponding url without index.php(stopping replication of url :P)
